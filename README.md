## **Ping Pong JS**

Ping Pong Javascript is a game developed using javascript canvas. Game features classic Ping Pong experience with intense artificial intelligence, three difficulty levels, great sound effects and fun gameplay. Based on feedback from players who tested the game I release new updates every once in a while with a distinct difference between each.
